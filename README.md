# UI-UX
UI/UX is the art of shaping digital experiences where UI (User Interface) is how things look—the buttons, colors, fonts, and layout.
UX (User Experience) is how things feel—how smoothly and satisfyingly a user can interact with a product.

For me, 
UI/UX design is a creative bridge that connects people with technology in the most beautiful, simple, and meaningful way.
It’s not just about making things pretty—it’s about making them work effortlessly, keeping the user at the heart of every decision.

"Design is not just what I do, it's how I speak without words."
